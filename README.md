## Part 1
1. The algorithm for determining the optimal threshold for stopping search of a list of numbers (expressed as a percentage of the list's length) is found in `HW1_Herrin_Brandon.py`. Running that Python script (e.g. `python3 HW1_Herrin_Brandon.py`) will determine the optimal threshold for stopping based on randomly-generated lists with uniform, normal (mean of 50, standard deviation of 10), and beta distributions (specifically Beta(2,7)).

2. The optimal stopping point for a randomly-generated list of uniform distribution was found to hover right around 37% (the stopping point fluctuates based upon the number of lists that are processed). This is in line with what we expect, given the mathematical proof we discussed in class.

## Part 2
1. Running `python3 HW1_Herrin_Brandon.py` also gives us an optimal stopping threshold for a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.

2. The standard distribution resulted on average in a higher optimal stopping threshold than the uniform distribution. 

3. Running `python3 HW1_Herrin_Brandon.py` also gives us an optimal stopping threshold for a beta distribution (Beta(2,7)).
